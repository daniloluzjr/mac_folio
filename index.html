            <h2>Experience with Computers</h2>
            <p>My passion for computers began with my first encounter with a 486, igniting a lasting fascination with technology. I delved into courses on MS-DOS and Windows, but found the challenges of Algebra and Calculus during my Computer Science studies frustrating. After some time, I ventured into the realm of graphic arts, which captivated my interest profoundly.  I've always found joy in being creative on the computer.</p>

            <h2>Experience in the Healthcare Field</h2>
            <p>Leaving IT led me to redirect my path towards the healthcare field, where I developed strong communication and empathy skills. I spent a rewarding year while I was in IT. Moving to the health field made this experience teach me the importance of organization, teamwork, and leadership, once I had the chance to teach in a renowned College.</p>

            <h2>Return to the IT Field</h2>
            <p>In 2018, I returned to IT, focusing on creation and design. I specialized in various projects, such as logo design, wedding invitations, caricatures, and business cards, exploring endless creative possibilities. Now in 2023, I've re-entered the IT field with determination, studying System Analysis and sharpening my programming skills at Alura Dev School. With a focus on HTML, CSS, Flutter, and Python, I'm on a path to develop mobile applications. I envision an innovative future where I can combine my passion for technology and healthcare to make a difference.</p>
